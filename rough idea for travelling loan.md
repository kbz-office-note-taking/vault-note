# loan amount 500$ to 5000$ dollars 



# procedure to take loan
- required documents, passport etc. 

# age restrictions
- for personal travelling loan. an individual who is 18 years old can take the loan. 
- for group or corporate travelling. there can be a minor who is less than 18 years old. (He/she should be more than 15 years old). other people are all adults who is 18 years old. 

# validation process. 
- financial consideration (in personal travelling, the person must have stable income for secured loan or must have collerateral or a person other than himself would take the joint plan to repay) He can't take unsecured loan. 
- for group loan (if one of the person leaves of become absent, the rest will share the debt to repay) They can choose unsecured or secured loan

# loan account creation


# personal or corporate loan
- Only an individual taking the loan for self travel(limit 500 to 5000 dollars)
- Group travelling, all the individual member will share the loan and repay the loan (limit 500 to 15000 dollars)

# special customers
- There can be people who just need to constantly travel due to their personal hobbies or those who travel for business requirements. 
- Or those students for local or abroad school projects
- Or other customers with special needs. 

# interest rate
- secured with collerateral or lien loan which the customer has deposit in the bank (10 to 12 percent interest rate) suitable for both bullet and term repayment.
- unsecured loan (higher interest rate, more than 15 percent) I am not sure if term loan or bullet repayment is suitable for this. 

# How would the customer like to take the loan?
- Since it is travelling, we can predefine the trip. i.e. 
Bank needs to Setup his acomondation, filight, food and drinks, touring places. This maybe conveinent for the customer since the bank will be setting up everything. And make the total amount of cost as a loan. 

Of course ==there will be free services from the bank. travelling meals and promotions etc.== 

Or 

The bank will just lend the money the customer asked for. He makes his own travelling plan. 
==there will be free services from the bank. travelling meals and promotions etc.== 

# settlement plans

Currently there are 2 payment methods I've thought of. Bullet type and term loan type. The loan amount won't be much since it is travelling. At most 5000 dollars. 
- bullet type >> pay right after the trip ==or== during the trip as soon as he has the amount to pay back. 
- term loan type >> loan tenor >> at most one year.
	- emi method >> automated by system (This is monthly payment.)
	- simple method for quarterly payment or configurable payment(We need to define manual process by the bank system user.)

# travelling local or abroad
- local travelling maybe lesser interest rate than travelling abroad. 
- promotion and sevices can be changed accordingly.
