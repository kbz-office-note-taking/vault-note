#### OD Loan

- Higher interest rate, possibly more than 15% or 19%.
- Service charges of 0.03% per transaction.
- Decrease the OD limit. Gradually reduce the available overdraft limit for specific clients, encouraging them to switch to a term loan for larger amounts.
- Stricter eligibility criteria.
- ==**Extend the approval process for overdraft applications.**==
- Set a frequency limit for using the OD service. For example, only 20 transactions are allowed within a month.

#### Normal Loan

- ==Automated loan application process. _This might not be easy and will require close collaboration with the development team. I’m not sure yet if they are developing their own software or using preexisting software._==
- Instant loan approval. This could be available through a mobile banking app.
    - Clients must have a strong profile for instant approval. This may include preset **collateral** and other requirements within the bank.
- Bundled services. Offer more loan packages and features.
    - For example, bonuses and additional services related to the loan.
- ==Lower interest rates for loans.==
- ==Reward programs. Possibly offer points or cashback incentives for taking out and repaying loans.==

#### Our Requirements

- IT requirements, i.e., new software implementation.
- New ideas and requirements that we haven’t thought of yet.
- This will require significant effort from us to make normal loans easier to access than OD loans.
