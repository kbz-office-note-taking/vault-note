The **installment type** refers to the structure or method of making payments on a loan. It defines how the loan repayments are scheduled and how they are calculated. Common installment types include:

1. **Equal Installments (EMI):** Borrowers make fixed payments each month over the loan term. Each installment includes both principal and interest.
    
2. **Graduated Payments:** Payments start lower and increase gradually over time, often used when the borrower expects their income to rise.
    
3. **Balloon Payments:** Smaller monthly payments with a large payment at the end of the loan term.
    
4. **Interest-Only Payments:** Borrowers pay only the interest for a period of time, after which they start paying both principal and interest.
    
5. **Flexible or Step-Up/Step-Down Payments:** Payments can be adjusted based on the borrowerâ€™s cash flow or income, either increasing or decreasing at different stages of the loan term.

The installment type affects the borrower's ability to repay and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.
