# A product vs a project. My own thought break down
- This is basically just a user usable product which will benefit to the company by its service charge and product price. 
- So, what is the product management? 
	- The first thing that comes to my mind. 
		- ==Errors==: There will be inconveniences and errors in the product. So, the product management should cover this. 
		- ==Delivery==: It is important to deliver the product to the right customer at the right time. 
		- ==Marketing==: It is also crucial to let the public know what we have for them. 
		- But the most important thing is the market's need. Without knowing what people want, we can create a product for them. Overall I see that a vision is important to create a product. If we have a vision, the other steps are systematic. But we still need to have the best workflow and management to manifest the vision into a working product. 
		- In creation the product, we have to follow systematic instruction to deliver the best outcome. I think that is what a ==project management== comes into play. 
		- So, in simple term, a product manager visions everything beforehand and to execute that plan he lays out every road map and connects the dots. After planning everything, each step become a project and the project management comes into play for the best execution. 
		- In programming, a product is the overall working project's final purpose and a project is the workflow of manifestation of the idea of product. So, a good vision makes a good product and a good discipline and (data structure and algorithm) make a good project.
